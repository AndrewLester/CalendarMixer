## About
Calendar Mixer's purpose is to provide an interface to filter events, export to a file, and add notifications to your Schoology calendar. In its current state, the existing Schoology calendar can only export *every* event, without alarms or filtering.

By providing both an alternative calendar viewer web app as well as an exportable iCalendar solution, Calendar Mixer is able to give additional features to your usual Schoology events.

Current additions:
- Filtering by Course ID
- Alerts for specific events
- Google Calendar Alerts support (with [external application](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyURKhzXN8wQ1nwFUDmaj_nIf-aNzgzolNL_SGp6bNlxzBSjLU/exec))
